SEPT - Flutter/frontend

## Getting Started

BackEnd:
Microservices:
Records: handles the ability to update and create heaslth records
Prescription: handles the ability to create prescription
Account: the ability to update and create doctor and user accounts as well as booking, schdule and profile features

Front end:
design for mobile.

Needs fixing:
atm docker can contain the microservices howver no port is expose for the container
this means front end cant actually communicate to it since theres no port

Unfinished:
Text chat feature for both patient and doctor.
